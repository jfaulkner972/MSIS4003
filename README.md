# MSIS 4003 System Analysis and Design

MSIS 4003 Final Project- Property Management Website

This is my final project for Oklahoma State University's MSIS 4003 System Analysis and Design course. This website was designed as a replacement for the project sponsor's existing website. In addition to updating the design of the website, one of the main goals of this project was to have a contact page that reported to a database to store contact information. 


This project was done in collaboration with Jake Pulliam and Michelle Meltke. Responsibilities are listed below.

UI Design: Jake Pulliam, Michelle Meltke, Jason Faulkner

Navigation, Responsive Design: Jake Pulliam

Content, Database Design: Michelle Meltke

Backend development, Infrastructure: Jason Faulkner

Current Work:

Comment code to improve readabillity.
